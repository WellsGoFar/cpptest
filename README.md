# Cpptest

This program was made to take coding tests on C++. Once the user opens the application, they can either sign up or sign in and then take a coding test. They can select a question they want and then a timer starts in the background and the user can write the code in a notepad. This code is then compiled and test cases are run on it and the result displayed back to the user.

## The main file is not main.cpp; there is no main.cpp file, sorry for the inconvinience. The main file is <u>homepage.cpp.<\u>
